Our first announcement of this year tackles two topics in particular.</p>\n<p>First, a <strong>SITREP</strong> on AUTONOMY+. Technical aspects are the main ingredient of this post, since we already handled the narrative dimension <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1811440/view/507321174540159233\">here</a>. Secondly, I want to introduce and discuss a <strong>paradigm</strong> with massive implications for our project.</p>\n<p>It's a technology with a good amount <strong>controversy</strong> \u2013 so I'm incredibly eager to hear what you think. First, though: Let's start with something unproblematic!</p>\n<h2>Status</h2>\n<div class=\"md-embed md-embed--16-9\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxdU0xPErHE\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>AUTONOMY has around 120 maps, 18 characters and 9000 lines of dialogue. AUTONOMY+ will have to have as much \u2013 if not more. I knew what was coming, but I didn't have a clear-cut <strong>strategy</strong>. Just a broad guideline: Whatever I'm able to produce in the daily aftermath of writing a 250-page book on <em>verbalized attribution of causality in German environmental discourse</em> is fine by me. </p>", "image": "https://padjohn.github.io/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/anarchy/STEAM_25-03-16.png", "date_published": "2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://padjohn.github.io/traki/blog/2025/02/26/proagon/", "url": "https://padjohn.github.io/traki/blog/2025/02/26/proagon/", "title": "ProAgon", "content_html": "<h1>ProAgon</h1>\n<h2>Hey Friends! \ud83d\udc4b</h2>\n<p><strong>I hope you had a stellar start of the year!</strong></p>\n<p>As you recall, we made a big <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1811440/view/527581830427181968\"><strong>announcement</strong></a> in December. Here's the recap: We're porting AUTONOMY to ANARCHY! It's a big project and a major confrontation with the past.</p>\n<p>To understand what we're dealing with, we'll take several pit-stops throughout this year. Our first impression hones in on the <strong>prologue</strong>. We'll talk about the good, the bad and the quirky. At the end of it, we pose a single question:</p>\n<p><em>What do we keep, add or rearrange?</em></p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2025/a97b1504154556808f308df2eeca7ee60963ba03.png\">\nLet's state the obvious: Good and bad are bound by perspective. Any part of AUTONOMY could be irreplaceable to someone, while someone else might find it cringe. One way to deal with that discrepancy is to forgo other people's opinion and stick with your own.</p>\n<p>It's my go-to strategy for <strong>conceptual</strong> stuff. I have a clear vision of a scene, people and happenings. If I was content on dreaming dreams by myself, this is where I'd stop. A mind full of ideas, mayhaps a tiny prototype. No builds. No TRACHI. No clout. </p>", "image": "https://padjohn.github.io/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/autonomy/STEAM_25-02-26.png", "date_published": "2025-02-26T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://padjohn.github.io/traki/blog/2024/12/31/trachi/", "url": "https://padjohn.github.io/traki/blog/2024/12/31/trachi/", "title": "TRACHI++", "content_html": "<h1>TRACHI++</h1>\n<h2>Hey Friends! \ud83d\udc4b</h2>\n<p>Look!

I reached out to several artists (like <a href=\"https://x.com/zuhzudi\"><strong>zuddi</strong></a>) and commissioned pieces left and right.
