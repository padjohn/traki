The Ionian Intelligence Service is [Ionia][]'s primary joint-intelligence and information agency.

Established in 1921, its main function is to act as an umbrella organization and coordinate the nation's individual institutions. To avoid conflicts of interest, all agents across all of Ionia's intelligence entities are formally employed by the IIS. The most prominent of these agencies are the [Endo-Kathartic Dialect][] and the [Commissariat for External Affairs][].

Above all, the IIS aims to act as a singular entity - both domestically and abroad. However, recent reports suggest that cooperation between EnKAD and CoExA remains lackluster, at best. An anonymous operative once supposedly stated: 

!!! quote "State of the union (1924/37) â€“ Tales from the shadow: Is the IIS too big to succeed?"

    *The IIS spends most of their time fighting itself.*

Rumors of infighting were galvanized in 1923, when a former founding official of the Ionian State revealed himself as the Colonel of [Trachi][]'s armed forces and publicized a detailed description of Operation [arteria][] in 1923. In the course of this incident, several members of the IIS were either apprehended or outright liquidated. Furthermore, significant portions of the organization were compromised. The Secretariat for State Security became the target of heavy scrutiny, with both the Undersecretary Ioanis Fero and the Secretary [Teron Pravoskos][] being subjected to several sets of internal inquiries.
