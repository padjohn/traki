Operation arteria was an operation conducted by the recently formed [IIS][] in 1923. <br>

Its goal was to overthrow the republican government of [Trachi][] and install a sympathetic leadership to facilitate the reintegration of the city into the Ionian sphere. To this end, it is assumed that more than several dozen operatives were involved, both from the former branches of the [Endo-Kathartic Dialect][] and the [Commissariat for External Affairs][].

To this day, it is unclear what exactly led the operation to end with devastating results for the IIS. Internal investigations are said to have unveiled several collaborators among the ranks of both EnKAD and CoExA members. 

One of the agents suspected to have sabotaged the operation was apprehended and is currently being questioned. According to an internal memorandum, the operative claimed that the then Undersecretary for State Security, [Ioanis Fero][] had also been involved. However, there is no definitive proof of his involvement as of today.
